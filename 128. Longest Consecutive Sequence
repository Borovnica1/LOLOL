Prob:

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 

Follow up: Could you implement the O(n) solution?

Sol:

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0
        s = set(nums)
        longestSeq = 1
        
        for n in nums:
            if n-1 not in s:
                l = 1
                while n+l in s:
                    l += 1
                longestSeq = max(l, longestSeq)
        return longestSeq
